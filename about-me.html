      <h2>Everything About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Alexis Padilla, I am a student at UCI. I am a Computer Game
        Science major who specializes in Human Computer Interactions. I love to
        play video games. So much that I dedicated my life to create games. I focus
        on the UI aspects of video games as I believe communicating with the player
        is as important as the gameplay and graphics of said games. It is important
        that the player can understand what is going on in the game.
      </p>
      <p>
        That said, I have also worked on other projects that relates to UI Design
        and other programs not related to UI. With these projects, I hope they
        allow you to understand how studious I can be.

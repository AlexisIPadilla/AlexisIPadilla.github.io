      <h2>Project Description</h2>
      <p>
        In our Informatics 141 class, we were tasked to create a search engine that
        can handle over 50,000 pages in short amount of time. Our group worked on
        both the Web Crawler and the Search Engine interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        In short, we wrote a search engine from the ground up that is capable of
        handling tens of thousands of documnets or Web pages, under harsh
        operational constriants and having a query response time under 300ms.
        This was our work process handling it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our team created a program that provided an inverted index for our search
        engine. The program created the index, where each word is which document
        and their importance to the documnet; the offset, where each word is
        positioned in the index text to save time when searching; and the docid map,
        where the index number corresponds to the actual web link or document.
      </p>
      <p>
        After creating our important files, we moved on to the search engine.
        After entering the search queary, it gets split up into keywords and
        searched for in the offset. Once the index positions are found, it skips
        reading the whole index document until it reaches the line that matters.
        After finding the approiate numbers and ranking them after our calculation,
        we get the top 5 results in our page.

      <h2>Project Description</h2>
      <p>
        Withered Away is a 2D platformer where you, The Player, must navigate
        through a desolate forest as a last survivor of your race. The game forces
        you to constantly move or else the player will lose. It's a game where you
        must continue to move no matter what.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the UI Designer, I've created and implemented the code to display the
        HUD of the game. I've decided on what would be used to help communicate to
        the player on how they are doing. In addition the the HUD, I've worked on
        the overall navigation bewtwen levels and menus.
      </p>
      <p>
        While I was the UI designer, I've also contrinuted to the overall game
        design decisions and themes. I've took the lead on how the game should feel
        when in the hands of players. It was quite a task to think about how it
        would all come together, but the project came out fine.

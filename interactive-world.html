      <h2>Project Description</h2>
      <p>
        In ICS 162, I was tasked with creating a living interactible world by
        models from scratch. I needed to create a player model from scratch as
        well as create objects the player can interact with.
      </p>
      <p>
        First off, the player model. I created my player model based off the
        character, Mr. Meeseeks from Rick and Morty, as I wanted to have a
        cartoonish looking character and translate into a 3D enviroment.
      </p>
      <p>
        I then created various objects the player can interact with. The items
        being a soccer ball and spinning obsctacles to mess around with the
        physics in the Unity Game Engine.
      </p>
      <p>
        In additon, I created a gate and goal the player can inteact with their
        keyboards. This was meant to experiment with both player and physical
        interactions in the game.
